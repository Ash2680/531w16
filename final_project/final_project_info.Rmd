#### Final project outline

Find a time series dataset of your choice. Carry out a time series analysis, taking advantage of what we have learned in this course. There are three main ways your final project can go beyond the scope of the midterm project: 

1. [Mechanistic modeling](#mechanistic-modeling). Develop and implement a mechanistic model to relate the data to equations describing the behavior of the system that make sense in the context of theoretical understanding of the system.

2. [Multi-dimensional time series and panel analysis](#multi-dimensional-time-series-and-panel-analysis), making sense of a collection of related time series. 

3. [Methodology not covered in class](#methodology-not-covered-in-class). If you think it is appropriate for your interests, it is fine for you to choose any approach for your final project that goes substantially beyond the classical linear time series analysis we focused on for the first half of this semester. This could involve using methodologies not covered in class, but if you find yourself heading that route you may want to check in with me. 


Write a report, as an R markdown (Rmd) file.  Submit the report by midnight on Thursday April 28 as a zip file containing an Rmd file and anything else necessary to allow the grader to render the Rmd file as an html document.

#### Choice of data

 As for the midterm project, the time series should hopefully have at least 100 time points. You can have less, if your interests demand it. Shorter data needs additional care, since model diagnostics and asymptotic approximations become more delicate on small datasets. If your data are longer than, say, 1000 time points, you can subsample if you start having problems working with too much data. 

Good higher-dimensional time series, or time series which you know how to connect to mechanistic hypotheses, may be informative to analyze but are harder find online than what we needed for the midterm project. Therefore, I expect more of you to come asking for help identifying a suitable project. One approach to this is for you to spend some time looking online and thinking about what you might like to do, then send me an email with your current thoughts and we can meet in office hours or after class and discuss it further.

#### Expectations for the report

The report will be graded on the same criteria as used for the midterm project.

* Raising a question. You should explain some background to the data you chose, and give motivation for the reader to appreciate the purpose of your data analysis. 

* Use of appropriate statistical methods.

* Scholarship. Your report should make references where appropriate. The models and methods you use should be fully explained, either by references or within your report. When using a reference to point the reader to descriptions elsewhere, you should provide a brief summary in your own report. Although you will be submitting your source code, you should not expect the reader to study it.

* Reaching a conclusion. You should say what you have concluded, as well as describing things you might have liked to do that were beyond the scope of this midterm project.

* Presentation of data analysis. Focus on a few, carefully explained and justified, figures, tables, statistics and hypothesis tests. You may want to try many things, but only write up evidence supporting how the data help you to get from your question to your conclusions. Including material that is of borderline relevance, or that is not fully explained, makes it harder for the reader to appreciate your analysis.

#### Mechanistic modeling

Relating a mechanistic model to time series data will likely involve following the POMP model structure developed in class, and using the **pomp** package to investigate your data. 

---------

#### Multi-dimensional time series and panel analysis

A large collection of related time series is sometimes called a **panel**.  Panel data are also called **longitudinal** data in Biostatistics. Small panels can be called **vector-valued time series** or **multivariate time series**. We will consider this kind of data in class.

#### Methodology not covered in class

This class has focused on ARMA and POMP models, two related approaches to time domain analysis of time series. Time series topics on which we will spend little or no time include frequency domain analysis of multivariate time series (Shumway and Stoffer, Chapter 7) and time-frequency domain analysis using wavelets (Shumway and Stoffer, Section 4.9). If you decide these approaches are particularly relevant for your data, you can use them for your project as an alternative or complementary approach to what we have covered in class. If you get stuck trying to learn these methods, or want to discuss them further, get in touch.
